<h2><center>About Us</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart Business was originally promoted in 1994 by Smart Limited, an Indian financial institution, and was its wholly-owned subsidiary. Smart shareholding in Smart Business was reduced to 46% through a public offering of shares in India in fiscal 1998, an equity offering in the form of ADRs listed on the NYSE in fiscal 2000, Smart Business acquisition of  Madura Limited in an all-stock amalgamation in fiscal 2001, and secondary market sales by Smart to institutional investors in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002.The principal objective was to create a development financial institution for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses. 

In the 1990s, Smart transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services group offering a wide variety of products and services, both directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like Smart Business. In 1999, Smart become the first Indian company and the first  financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;After consideration of various corporate structuring alternatives in the context of the emerging competitive scenario in the Indian industry, and the move towards universal banking, the managements of Smart and Smart Business formed the view that the merger of Smart with Smart Business would be the optimal strategic alternative for both entities, and would create the optimal legal structure for the Smart group's universal banking strategy. The merger would enhance value for Smart shareholders through the merged entity's access to low-cost deposits, greater opportunities for earning fee-based income and the ability to participate in the payments system and provide transaction-banking services. The merger would enhance value for Smart Business shareholders through a large capital base and scale of operations, seamless access to ICICI's strong corporate relationships built up over five decades, entry into new business segments, higher market share in various business segments, particularly fee-based services.
